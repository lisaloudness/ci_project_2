## **Introduction**

Welcome to the Love Logo Quiz!

Love Logo is a mindful quiz that helps focus and concentration but most of all it's fun.
The inspiration for this quiz are my children. I wanted to develop a game that develops cognitive intelligence and visual memory.
It can be played on your own or with others. With this game, screen time becomes a positive neurological exercise, developing critical thinking, spelling and attention to detail.
Lovo Logo is intended for children and adults (5+years).

Please note that this quiz was created for the Code Instituteâ€™s Milestone Project 2 as part of their Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. The requirements are to design, develop and implement an interactive front-end website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## **UI**

### Layout

- A simple and colorful page structure so that the user can easily find the game.
- "Play" button - takes the user to the play section.
- "How to play?" button - provides information about the game rules.
- Incorrect guesses counter - the player shall have 4 incorrect guesses per logo.
- 2 minute timer shown as a reverse progress bar. The player will need to guess as many correct logos as they can within two minutes.
- "Incorrect Modal" - triggered when the player either guesses 4 incorrect letters.
- "Well Done Modal" - triggered when the player guesses the correct letters to reveal the name of the brand.
- High Score table - user can view their top five high scores which are saved to and called from local storage.
- Footer - contains social links.

### Structure

- **Title**

  - located at the top of the page and will also navigate to home page on click.

- **Container**

  - White container holds quiz content positioned page center.

- **Play Section**

  - within the container, the Play Screen consists of 2 sections. The Logo image question is displayed on the left and the quiz elements are displayed on the right. The dynamic keyboard is live for the user to select the letters that they believe is the name of the brand.

  The design of this site is bright and bold with 2 tone colors. The aesthetic design of the game is kept simple to enable an intuitive UX experience and the main goal of this game is to be fun. The site is intended for children and adults and the content of the logos can be easily adapted and updated to target specific user groups.

### Design Walkthrough

The quiz consists of 2 main pages:-

The first page is the landing page of the game and consists of a title and content container. The container contains the game brand logo and 3 control buttons:-

- **Play Button**
  - located in the container above the "How to Play" button, takes the user to the game section.
- **How to play Button**
  - located in the container below the "Play" button, with a click a modal opens that displays text stating how to play the game.
- **High Score Button**
  - located in the container below the "How To Play" button. Users top five high scores will be saved to local storage and will be called to create a sorted list when button is pressed.

The second page is the game section. This section contains the game container. On loading, the dynamic keyboard populates inside the container, using the same bold color as the previous control buttons. Above the keyboard is the word guess area which, visually, are underscores, until the user selects a correct letter which then is made visible in the word.
The dynamic keyboard is populated using JS and has the same layout as a traditional keyboard. After a letter has been selected, the keyboard key will change color, indicating to the user that the letter has been used during the game and is now inactive.
Incorrect Guesses counter and Overall Score counter is positioned in container right.

The picture of the logo is positioned left side of the game container.

### Color Scheme

Using the [COOLERS](https://coolors.co/image-picker) color palette generator, the color scheme chosen is based on the logo.

- #5E63BA is the main color throughout the quiz with contrasting white game container.
- #FFFFFF is the game container which is a bold contrast to the purple background.

## **Deployment**

### GitHub Pages

1. Log into GitHub and locate the repository 'ci_project_2'
2. [Click here to view](https://github.com/lisaloudness/ci_project_2/settings/pages)
3. At the top locate the settings option.
4. Scroll towards the bottom of the page and locate GitHub Pages.
5. Under 'Source' dropdown, click 'Master' from the options.
6. Click the save button.
7. The site is now published, it may not be available immediately.
8. The site URL is visible on the top of "Github Pages".

### Run Locally

1. Log into GitHub and select a repository to download.
2. Select code and Download the ZIP file.
3. Once the download is complete, you can extract the file and use it in your local environment.

## **Bugs**

1. Latency issue with the modal image. When the modal is called, there is a slight delay from the last called image to correct image.
2. When validating errors and beautifing my code as final finishes to project, this broke my code so I had to revert to a previous commit. This was mainly in index.html where elements have empty values as js determines the value. This caused errors in validation but any fixes would break the code so left as is. This process broke my code to what was the perfect project. Despite rolling back to a previous commit I still couldn't get the high score to work as it did (omitting null in the list).
3. Backend server issues with codeanywhere during final days of project very frustrating - unable to fully complete project as I would have liked.

## **Future Development**

1. Add more levels to increase difficulty.
2. Tailor the content to specific age groups (5-10; 8-15; 10+).
3. Tailor the logos into specific categories (ie. cars, confectionary, toys, etc).
4. Add music during gameplay.
5. Add sound effects to emphasize emoji.
6. Increase logo database.
7. Add interactive user feedback form.
8. Add feedback message and Try Again button to Time Out modal.
